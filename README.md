# TDDE16_project
Fake news classification using Logistic regression and DistilBERT. This project is part of the course TDDE16 (text mining) and Link√∂ping University

To run the project, you first need to download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/fake-news-classification
The reason why it is not included in the repo is because it is too big for github to handle.
